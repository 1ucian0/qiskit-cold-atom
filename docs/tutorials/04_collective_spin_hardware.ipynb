    "Collective spins can be experimentally realized by trapping a cloud of bosonic atoms with two internal states (denoted $\\uparrow$ and $\\downarrow$) i.e. effective spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$-systems in a Bose-Einstein-Condensate (BEC) [1]. Due to their bosonic indistinguishability, the state of $N$ such spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particles can be described as the state of one long angular momentum (or \"spin\") of length $L=\\frac{N}{2}$ [1]. This so-called \"collective spin\" has $2L+1$ internal states which are the eigenstates of the projection onto the quantization axis $L_z$. \n",
